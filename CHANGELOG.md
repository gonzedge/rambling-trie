    `Marshal` is used when a format isn't recognized.

  ``` ruby

  Rambling::Trie.dump your_trie, 'a filename'

  # Load a trie from a file into memory
  trie = Rambling::Trie.load 'a filename'
  ```

  by [@gonzedge][github_user_gonzedge]

  ``` ruby
  Rambling::Trie.config do |config|

  - `#words_within?` returns `true` as soon as it finds one matching word

- Add `#==` to compare nodes by [@gonzedge][github_user_gonzedge]
