# Contributing to Rambling Trie

1. If you have found a bug or have a feature request, please [search through the issues][github_issues_all] to see if it
   has already been reported. If that's not the case, then [create a new one][github_issues_new] with a full description
   of what you have found or what you need.
2. If you have bug fix or a feature implementation in mind, then [fork Rambling Trie][github_fork] and create a branch
   with a descriptive name.
3. Get the gem up and running locally (tests are written in RSpec):

    ```sh
    bundle install
    bundle exec rake
    ```

4. Implement your bug fix or feature - ***make sure to add tests!***
